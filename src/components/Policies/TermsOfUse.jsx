                </li>
                <p>The Service is intended to allow our customers to send or request money remittances, from the United States to the Philippines. We recommend that you use the Service only to send money to people you know personally, such as family and friends. You should never use the Service to send requests or money to strangers.</p>
                <p>Where required by law, SendFriend is a licensed provider of money remittance services, and all money transmission is provided by SendFriend.</p>
                <p>A "<strong>Sender</strong>" is someone who uses the Service to send money. A "<strong>Recipient</strong>" is an individual who sends a money remittance request to a Sender or receives money from a Sender through the Service. The "<strong>Recipient Country</strong>" is the country in which the Recipient receives money through the Service. A "<strong>Transaction</strong>" is a specific instruction to send money through the Service for a remittance. The "<strong>Transaction Amount</strong>" is the amount that the Sender provides to us to send the Transaction, excluding the Transaction Fee (as defined in "<strong>Payment</strong>" below). The "<strong>Payout Amount</strong>" is the amount paid out to the Recipient, excluding any taxes or charges that may be levied under the laws of the Recipient Country (the "<strong>Local Taxes</strong>"). All Transaction Fees (defined herein) related to the Service are made free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for and on account of, any taxes, duties or other deductions. Any such deduction or withholding, if required by the laws of any country are your sole responsibility.</p>

                        <p><strong>Not Available to Certain Users</strong>. The Service may not be available in whole or in part in different countries and jurisdictions as determined by local laws and regulations or if we reasonably determine that providing the Service in a particular country or jurisdiction presents an unacceptable level of risk to us, our users, or our systems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Not Available for Certain Transactions</strong>. We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, refuse any Transaction. This may include Transactions from certain Senders or to certain Recipients, including without limitation, entities and individuals that are included on the Specially Designated Nationals list, Non-cooperative Countries and Territories list, United Nations Security Council Sanctions List, and such other lists as may be issued from time to time by government agencies. We may also, at any time and in our sole discretion, limit the amount to be transferred on a per Transaction basis or an aggregated basis without prior notice.

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Charges</strong>. For each Transaction that you submit, you agree to pay us a transaction fee (the <strong>"Transaction Fee"</strong>), if applicable, plus the Transaction Amount.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate</strong>. We and our Service Providers (defined below) usually make money when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Transaction is paid out in another currency. We may make money based on the difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to you.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Local Taxes</strong>. Local Taxes may be applicable. If applicable, they will be disclosed to you in the Service prior to you authorizing a Transaction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Other Charges</strong>. We are not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example (without limitation), your credit card issuer may charge you a cash advance fee and interest if you use a credit card as a Payment Instrument. We are not responsible for any such fees, nor are we responsible for non-sufficient funds charges, chargeback fees, or other similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit or debit card issuer, or other provider in connection with your use of the Service. If you submit a Transaction that results in us being charged non-sufficient fund fees, chargeback fees, or other similar fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Payment Terms</strong>. Payment is due at the time your Transaction is submitted for processing although we may choose not to debit your Payment Instrument immediately. For us to collect payment from you and complete your Transaction, you authorize us to access, charge, electronically transfer, or debit funds from any of the payment instruments you provide us in connection with your use of the Service (each, a <strong>"Payment Instrument"</strong>) including, for example, your credit card, debit card or bank account. Not all Payment Instruments are always available to all customers. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse Transactions funded from certain Payment Instruments. You will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer once SendFriend initiates the transfer from your account which may be after your Payout Amount has been received by your Recipient or Service Company. You authorize us to re-try debiting your Payment Instrument or a different Payment Instrument one or more times if your payment fails or is insufficient. For example, if there are insufficient funds in your bank account at the time you submit your Transaction, we may try to debit your bank account or charge your credit card if you provide it as a different Payment Instrument at a later time. You confirm that you are the lawful owner of your Payment Instrument(s). For certain Transactions, your Recipient may receive the transferred funds before your Payment Instrument is debited the Transaction Amount, the Transaction Fee, or any other applicable fees.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Verification</strong>. You agree we may verify your Payment Instrument in connection with a Transaction. For example, you agree we may from time to time credit your bank account, as part of our effort to confirm ownership of the account. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to SendFriend to make the transfers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We work with local banks, money exchange houses, and other third-party service providers (each, a <strong>"Service Provider"</strong>) to pay funds out to Recipients. We attempt to provide up-to-date information on our websites regarding the location, availability, and hours of our Service Providers. However, you should directly confirm hours of operation and location with the Service Provider.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Verification</strong>. Recipients may be required to prove their identity before receiving funds by presenting authentic, valid, and current identification document(s) from a list of acceptable forms of identification. In addition, Recipients may be required to provide a Transaction number and/or another, similar identifier associated with their Transaction. You give us permission to contact your Recipient and store all such data, as necessary to provide the Service. Please verify account information and bank details are correct prior to submitting your Transaction because we are not responsible for detecting inaccuracies. If account information and bank details are incorrect, money may be sent to the wrong bank account and may not be recovered.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Deposits to Bank Accounts</strong>. If you choose to send a Transaction to a Recipient's bank account, you confirm the Recipient’s bank account is denominated in the same currency as the Transaction (e.g., if your Transaction calls for us to deposit pesos into the Recipient's bank account, then you confirm that the Recipient's bank account is denominated in Philippine pesos).</p>

We may delay or cancel your Transaction for reasons that include but are not limited to: identity verification; validation of your Transaction instructions and Payment Instruments; anti-fraud and anti-money laundering compliance review; contacting and locating you, your Sender, or your Recipient; and to comply with applicable law. Business hours, systems availability and currency availability of our Service Providers may also cause delays.

                        <li><p>To request a refund, please click <a href="https://www.sendfriend.io/contact-us">here</a> for Customer Service, or email us at <a href="mailto:info@sendfriend.io">info@sendfriend.io</a>. We will refund your money within five (5) business days of your request to cancel a transfer if the funds have not already been picked up or deposited into a Recipient’s account and we are able to reverse the transaction. You can cancel your Transaction for a full refund within 30 minutes of authorizing your Transaction unless the funds have already been paid out to the Recipient or Service Company. After 30 minutes, we generally do not provide refunds unless we did not process your Transaction according to your instructions or we are unable to pay out the Transaction. While we will make every effort not to debit your Payment Instrument after we have received your request for cancellation, in some cases, we may have initiated an irreversible request for funds from your financial institution prior to receiving your request for cancellation. In such cases, your Payment Instrument may be debited even if you have cancelled your Transaction, but we will refund your money usually within four (4) business days after we have received the funds from your financial institution.</p>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>If the requested refund is with respect to erroneous or unauthorized transaction, you must notify the Company in writing of such error or unauthorized transaction within 60 days after the order is executed, or any periodic statement containing the error is sent to the customer, whichever is later. You also have the right to request information to determine whether the transaction was in fact in error or unauthorized. After due investigation SendFriend will refund the principal to the extent possible, but depending on the circumstances, not the charged fee.      </p>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Refunds will be credited to the same Payment Instrument used to pay for the Transaction. Refunds are only made in same currency used to pay for the Transaction ("Send Currency"). Refund amounts will not be adjusted to account for changes in the value of the Send Currency from the time your Transaction was submitted.</p>
                    </li>
                        <li><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, specific refund provisions may apply depending on your country or state of residence. Please see the Country Specific Provisions below for further information.</p>

This may include Transactions from certain Senders or to certain Recipients, including without limitation, entities and individuals that are included on the Specially Designated Nationals list, Non-cooperative Countries and Territories list, United Nations Security Council Sanctions List, and such other lists as may be issued from time to time by government agencies.

                        <p><strong>Charges</strong>. For each Transaction that you submit, you agree to pay us a transaction fee (the <strong>"Transaction Fee"</strong>), if applicable, plus the Transaction Amount.</p>

                        <p><strong>Foreign Currency Exchange Rate</strong>. We and our Service Providers (defined below) usually make money when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Transaction is paid out in another currency. We may make money based on the difference between the exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate provided to you.</p>

                        <p><strong>Other Charges</strong>. We are not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with your Payment Instruments. For example (without limitation), your credit card issuer may charge you a cash advance fee and interest if you use a credit card as a Payment Instrument. We are not responsible for any such fees, nor are we responsible for non-sufficient funds charges, chargeback fees, or other similar charges that might be imposed on you by your bank, credit or debit card issuer, or other provider in connection with your use of the Service. If you submit a Transaction that results in us being charged non-sufficient fund fees, chargeback fees, or other similar fees, you agree to reimburse us for all such fees.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Payment Terms</strong>. Payment is due at the time your Transaction is submitted for processing although we may choose not to debit your Payment Instrument immediately. For us to collect payment from you and complete your Transaction, you authorize us to access, charge, electronically transfer, or debit funds from any of the payment instruments you provide us in connection with your use of the Service (each, a <strong>"Payment Instrument"</strong>) including, for example, your credit card, debit card or bank account. Not all Payment Instruments are always available to all customers. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse Transactions funded from certain Payment Instruments. You will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer once SendFriend initiates the transfer from your account which may be after your Payout Amount has been received by your Recipient or Service Company. You authorize us to re-try debiting your Payment Instrument or a different Payment Instrument one or more times if your payment fails or is insufficient. For example, if there are insufficient funds in your bank account at the time you submit your Transaction, we may try to debit your bank account or charge your credit card if you provide it as a different Payment Instrument at a later time. You confirm that you are the lawful owner of your Payment Instrument(s). For certain Transactions, your Recipient may receive the transferred funds before your Payment Instrument is debited the Transaction Amount, the Transaction Fee, or any other applicable fees.</p>

                        <p><strong>Verification</strong>. You agree we may verify your Payment Instrument in connection with a Transaction. For example, you agree we may from time to time credit your bank account, as part of our effort to confirm ownership of the account. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to SendFriend to make the transfers.</p>

We attempt to provide up-to-date information on our websites regarding the location, availability, and hours of our Service Providers.

                        <p><strong>Verification</strong>. Recipients may be required to prove their identity before receiving funds by presenting authentic, valid, and current identification document(s) from a list of acceptable forms of identification. In addition, Recipients may be required to provide a Transaction number and/or another, similar identifier associated with their Transaction. You give us permission to contact your Recipient and store all such data, as necessary to provide the Service. Please verify account information and bank details are correct prior to submitting your Transaction because we are not responsible for detecting inaccuracies. If account information and bank details are incorrect, money may be sent to the wrong bank account and may not be recovered.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Deposits to Bank Accounts</strong>. If you choose to send a Transaction to a Recipient's bank account, you confirm the Recipient’s bank account is denominated in the same currency as the Transaction (e.g., if your Transaction calls for us to deposit pesos into the Recipient's bank account, then you confirm that the Recipient's bank account is denominated in Philippine pesos).</p>

We will refund your money within five (5) business days of your request to cancel a transfer if the funds have not already been picked up or deposited into a Recipient’s account and we are able to reverse the transaction. You can cancel your Transaction for a full refund within 30 minutes of authorizing your Transaction unless the funds have already been paid out to the Recipient or Service Company. After 30 minutes, we generally do not provide refunds unless we did not process your Transaction according to your instructions or we are unable to pay out the Transaction. While we will make every effort not to debit your Payment Instrument after we have received your request for cancellation, in some cases, we may have initiated an irreversible request for funds from your financial institution prior to receiving your request for cancellation. In such cases, your Payment Instrument may be debited even if you have cancelled your Transaction, but we will refund your money usually within four (4) business days after we have received the funds from your financial institution.</p>

You also have the right to request information to determine whether the transaction was in fact in error or unauthorized.
