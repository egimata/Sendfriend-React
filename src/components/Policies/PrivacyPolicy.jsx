            <p  >This privacy policy explains how and why SendFriend Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>SendFriend</strong>&rdquo;) collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. &ldquo;<strong>Personal data</strong>&rdquo; in this policy means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.</p>
            <h1  >Your Privacy Rights &amp; Choices</h1>
            <p  >You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we&rsquo;ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sendfriend.io">info@sendfriend.io</a>. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
            <p  >If you request to see or delete your personal data, we&rsquo;ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can&rsquo;t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.</p>
            <p  >If you want to delete your personal data, you can (A) contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sendfriend.io">info@sendfriend.io</a>, or (B) close your account. However, if you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:</p>
            <ul  >
            <li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement [<span >link</span>] or other contract you have with us</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li>
            <li>Protect your (or another person&rsquo;s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li>
            <li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services</li>
            <li>Comply with laws</li>
            </ul>
            <p  >Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice (see below) for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p>
            <h1  >Our Communications With You</h1>
            <p  >Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences. Optional (marketing) communications will contain a link allowing you to unsubscribe from those communications. However, you won&rsquo;t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account&rsquo;s status that require your attention.</p>

            <p  >If you have an account with SendFriend, we will associate information from all these sources with your account to improve your experience and for compliance and analytics purposes.</p>
            <p  >We do not knowingly collect personal information from people who are not allowed to use our sites and services. Contact us if you believe that we&rsquo;ve mistakenly collected personal data from someone not allowed to use our services.

            <h1  >Use of Tracking Technologies</h1>
            <p  >We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services.

            <p  >You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.</p>
            <p  >Some web browsers have an optional setting called &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Some of our services may not function without tracking data; accordingly, we may not respond to DNT settings and/or the usage of DNT settings may impact the availability of the services.</p>

            <h1  >Overview</h1>
            <p  >This privacy policy explains how and why SendFriend Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>SendFriend</strong>&rdquo;) collects, stores, uses, and shares personal data when you visit our websites or use our services. Reading it will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. &ldquo;<strong>Personal data</strong>&rdquo; in this policy means information about you, including your identity, finances, and online behavior.</p>
            <h1  >Your Privacy Rights &amp; Choices</h1>
            <p  >You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we&rsquo;ve collected about you in the past 12 months. You also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data we collected about you. If you want to see or delete your personal data, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sendfriend.io">info@sendfriend.io</a>. We will not deny you services, charge you different prices, or provide you with a different level of service solely for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
            <p  >If you request to see or delete your personal data, we&rsquo;ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. If we can&rsquo;t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request.</p>
            <p  >If you want to delete your personal data, you can (A) contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sendfriend.io">info@sendfriend.io</a>, or (B) close your account. However, if you close your account or request that we delete personal data, we still need to keep some personal data so we can:</p>
            <ul  >
            <li>Complete a transaction, provide goods or services you requested, or comply with our promises to you in the User Agreement [<span >link</span>] or other contract you have with us</li>
            <li>Detect and prevent malicious, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li>
            <li>Protect your (or another person&rsquo;s) legal rights, including the right to free speech</li>
            <li>Manage our internal business processes that are reasonably related to your expectations when using our services</li>
            <li>Comply with laws</li>
            </ul>
            <p  >Depending on where you live and what type of account you use, you may have different rights and choices for managing your personal data. For example, certain State privacy laws do not apply to personal data collected, processed, or disclosed by a financial institution according to federal laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Consumers may read our Consumer Privacy Notice (see below) for more information about their rights under US federal law.</p>
            <h1  >Our Communications With You</h1>
            <p  >Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences. Optional (marketing) communications will contain a link allowing you to unsubscribe from those communications. However, you won&rsquo;t be able to opt out of messages that are considered necessary for you to manage your account, such as receipts and emails that alert you to changes in your account&rsquo;s status that require your attention.</p>

            <h1  >Use of Tracking Technologies</h1>
            <p  >We or our authorized service providers may use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect personal data whenever you use our services, visit our sites, or visit websites that offer our services.

            <p  >You can disable or decline some cookies for our sites and services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use.</p>
            <p  >Some web browsers have an optional setting called &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Some of our services may not function without tracking data; accordingly, we may not respond to DNT settings and/or the usage of DNT settings may impact the availability of the services.</p>
