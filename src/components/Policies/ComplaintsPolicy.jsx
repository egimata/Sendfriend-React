            </li>
            
            <p >A “Complaint” is information received by SendFriend from customer that contains an allegation of a specific breach or failure by SendFriend or its employees to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations governing its business or operations, or that SendFriend committed an error in processing a customer’s transaction. As an international remittance company, various aspects of the Company’s business are governed by regulatory “guidance” and/or regulations such as Regulation E, and is supervised by various regulators such as Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Consumer Financial Protection Board (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Accordingly, the way certain Complaints are resolved may differ depending on the applicable regulatory framework. </p>

                <h1 >Electronic Fund Transfer Act & Error Resolution Requests</h1>
            </li>
            <p >Congress passed the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) in 1978 to protect consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers (EFTs). The law provides the legal framework for the rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of participants in EFT systems. Among its provisions, Regulation E specifies procedures that institutions must follow for investigating and resolving errors alleged by consumers for EFTs.</p>

                    <p><strong>Errors.</strong> Information SendFriend receives from customers alleging that SendFriend erroneously accepted and processed an unauthorized transfer, or incorrectly processed an authorized transfer, will be deemed a Complaint and handled in accordance with this policy. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>SendFriend will consider the notice of an EFTA error timely if it is received in writing (A) within 60 days after the order is executed, or any periodic statement containing the error is sent to the customer, whichever is later; or (B) within 60 days of SendFriend sending clarifying documentation or information to the customer regarding a particular order upon a customer’s request. The Company will accept notifications of an error orally but will require the customer to confirm the notification in writing within 10 days of providing the oral notice. SendFriend will inform the customer of this requirement and how the confirmation may be provided at the time of the oral notification. </p>

                                        <p>The difference results from the application of non-covered third-party fees or taxes collected on the remittance transfer by a person other than the provider and the provider provided the required disclosure.</p>

                            </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p>The extraordinary circumstances noted above</p>

                                    <li>
                                        <p>The transfer being made with fraudulent intent by the sender or any person acting in concert with the sender (e.g., “friendly fraud”)</p>

                            <p>The rule also provides examples of situations that are not considered errors. For example, it is not an error if the customer instructed SendFriend to send rubles but the recipient requests on his or her own to pick up funds in euros.</p>

                    <li>
                            <p><strong>Resolution Requests.</strong> Resolution requests include a customer’s request for documentation or for additional information or clarification concerning a remittance transfer, including a request a customer makes to determine whether an error exists. Customers have up to 60 days to submit a resolution request in respect of a particular transfer. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Error Handling & Refunds.</strong> SendFriend will make a determination with respect to a reported error within 45 days of its receipt of notice of the error. The results of the investigation will be communicated to the sender within 3 business days after completing the investigation. If an error occurred it will be corrected within 1 business day, or as soon as reasonably practicable or based on receiving senders’ instructions (ex: cancelation, settle w/ receiver). If a refund is warranted, a refund will include any fees and, if not prohibited by law, any taxes imposed in connection with the transfer.</p>

                    <p>An act or practice is deceptive where: &nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <p>A representation, omission, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer;&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A consumer&rsquo;s interpretation of the representation, omission, or practice is considered reasonable under the circumstances; or</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The misleading representation, omission, or practice is material.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A material misrepresentation or practice is one that is likely to affect a consumer&rsquo;s choice of or conduct regarding a product. In other words, it is information that is important to consumers. If inaccurate or omitted information is material, injury is likely.&nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i" >
                        <li>
                            <p>Certain categories of information are automatically considered material. First, express claims are presumed to be material. The Supreme Court has stated that we may assume that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising. Where the seller knew, or should have known, that an ordinary consumer would need omitted information to evaluate the product or service, or that the claim was false, materiality will be presumed because the business intended the information or omission to have an effect. Similarly, when evidence exists that a business intended to make an implied claim, materiality will be inferred.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Claims or omissions are considered material if they significantly involve health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned. Depending on the facts, information pertaining to the central characteristics of the product or service will be presumed material. Information has been found material where it concerns the purpose, safety, efficacy, or cost, of the product or service. Information is also likely to be material if it concerns durability, performance, warranties, or quality. &nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When materiality exists injury to the consumer is also likely to exist because of the representation, omission, sales practice, or marketing technique. Injury to consumers can take many forms. Injury exists if consumers would have chosen differently but for the deception. If different choices are likely, the claim is material, and injury is likely as well. Therefore, injury and materiality are different names for the same concept.&nbsp;</p>
