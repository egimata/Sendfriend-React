            <p >It is the policy of SendFriend, Inc. (&ldquo;SendFriend&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) to comply with Section 1036 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits &ldquo;unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce,&rdquo; and all published guidance by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &ldquo;CFPB&rdquo;) and other applicable regulators regarding managing risks relating to unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices (&ldquo;UDAAP&rdquo;) and general guidance on measures that financial institutions can take to avoid engaging in such acts or practices, including best practices. Section 1031 of Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to declare a product or service abusive if it: &nbsp;</p>

                <h1 >Legal Standards Under The Dodd-Frank Act&nbsp;</h1>
            </li>
            <p >The legal standards for unfairness and deception are independent of each other. Depending on the facts, a practice may be unfair, deceptive, or both. The legal standards set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act are briefly described below. &nbsp;</p>
            
            <ol type="a"  >
                <li>
                    <p>An act or practice is unfair where it: &nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i" >
                        <li>
                            <p>Causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Cannot be reasonably avoided by consumers&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <p >Public policy, as established by statute, regulation, or judicial decisions may be considered with all other evidence in determining whether an act or practice is unfair. &nbsp;</p>
                <li>
                    <p>An act or practice is deceptive where: &nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <p>A representation, omission, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer;&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>A consumer&rsquo;s interpretation of the representation, omission, or practice is considered reasonable under the circumstances; or</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The misleading representation, omission, or practice is material.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>A material misrepresentation or practice is one that is likely to affect a consumer&rsquo;s choice of or conduct regarding a product. In other words, it is information that is important to consumers. If inaccurate or omitted information is material, injury is likely.&nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i" >
                        <li>
                            <p>Certain categories of information are automatically considered material. First, express claims are presumed to be material. The Supreme Court has stated that we may assume that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising. Where the seller knew, or should have known, that an ordinary consumer would need omitted information to evaluate the product or service, or that the claim was false, materiality will be presumed because the business intended the information or omission to have an effect. Similarly, when evidence exists that a business intended to make an implied claim, materiality will be inferred.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Claims or omissions are considered material if they significantly involve health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned. Depending on the facts, information pertaining to the central characteristics of the product or service will be presumed material. Information has been found material where it concerns the purpose, safety, efficacy, or cost, of the product or service. Information is also likely to be material if it concerns durability, performance, warranties, or quality. &nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>When materiality exists injury to the consumer is also likely to exist because of the representation, omission, sales practice, or marketing technique. Injury to consumers can take many forms. Injury exists if consumers would have chosen differently but for the deception. If different choices are likely, the claim is material, and injury is likely as well. Therefore, injury and materiality are different names for the same concept.&nbsp;</p>

                <h1 >Compliance Risk Evaluation &nbsp;</h1>
            </li>
                    
            <p >UDAAP violations can present significant legal, reputational and compliance risks for SendFriend. SendFriend senior management will consider UDAAP implications when analyzing the risks associated with all products and services it offers. They will also consider potential UDAAP risks at every stage of business activity from product development, to the creation and rollout of marketing campaigns, to servicing and collections. They will pay particular attention to new or modified systems or products and third-party arrangements. UDAAP applies to both consumer and commercial services.&nbsp;</p>

                <h1 >Managing Risks Associated with Unfair and Deceptive Acts &amp; Practices &nbsp;</h1>
            </li>

            <p >SendFriend will follow the below best practices to avoid misleading its customers or the general public about its products and services:&nbsp;</p>
            <ol type="a" >
                <li>
                    <p>Review all promotional materials, marketing scripts, and customer agreements and disclosures to ensure that they fairly and adequately describe the terms, benefits, and material limitations of the product or service being offered, including any related or optional products or services, and that they do not misrepresent such terms either affirmatively or by omission.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that these materials do not use fine print, separate statements, or inconspicuous disclosures to correct potentially misleading headlines, and ensure that there is a reasonable factual basis for all representations made.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Draw the attention of customers to key terms, including limitations and conditions, that are important in enabling the customer to make an informed decision regarding whether the product or service meets the customer&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Clearly disclose all material limitations or conditions on the terms or availability of products or services, such the expiration date for terms that apply only during an introductory period; material prerequisites for obtaining particular products, services, or terms (e.g., minimum transaction amounts, introductory or other fees, or other qualifications); or conditions for canceling a service without charge when the service is offered on a free trial basis.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Inform customers in a clear and timely manner about any fees, penalties, or other charges (including charges for any force-placed products) that have been imposed, and the reasons for their imposition.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Clearly inform customers of contract provisions that permit a change in the terms and conditions of an agreement.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When using terms such as &ldquo;pre-approved&rdquo; or &ldquo;guaranteed,&rdquo; clearly disclose any limitations, conditions, or restrictions on the offer.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Clearly inform customers when the account terms approved by SendFriend for the consumer are less favorable than the advertised terms or terms previously disclosed.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Tailor advertisements, promotional materials, disclosures, and scripts to take account of the sophistication and experience of the target audience. It will not make claims, representations or statements that mislead customers of the target audience about the cost, value, availability, cost savings, benefits, or terms of the product or service. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that costs and benefits of optional or related products and services are not misrepresented or presented in an incomplete manner. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Avoid using unrepresentative examples in advertising, marketing, and promotional materials. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Clearly disclose a telephone number and mailing address (and, as an addition, a contact form on its website at <a href="http://www.sendfriend.io/contact">www.sendfriend.io/contact</a>) that customers may use to contact SendFriend or its third-party service providers regarding any complaints they may have, and maintain appropriate procedures for resolving complaints. SendFriend management and compliance staff will review all complaints to identify practices that have the potential to be misleading to customers. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Implement and maintain effective risk and supervisory controls to select and manage third-party servicers. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ensure that employees and third parties who market or promote SendFriend products are adequately trained to avoid making statements or taking actions that might be unfair or deceptive. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Review compensation arrangements for SendFriend employees as well as third-party vendors and servicers to ensure that they do not create unintended incentives to engage in unfair or deceptive practices. &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Recognizing the need for clear and accurate disclosures for certain groups of the general public which have been associated in the past with abusive practices, SendFriend will pay particular attention to marketing products and services to the elderly, the financially vulnerable, and customers who are not financially sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
               
            <li >
                <h1 >UDAAP Red Flags</h1>
            </li>

            <p >Red flags are warnings or indictors of a potential problem that poses risk to the Company. The below red flags are examples designed to help SendFriend management identify warning signs of potential areas with higher UDAAP risks.</p>
            <ol type="a" >
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Customer Complaints.</strong> Customer complaints can indicate potential weaknesses or other deficiencies, such as potential UDAAP issues. Complaints can reveal a weakness in a particular product or service or can identify customers&rsquo; dissatisfaction with or lack of understanding of products or services, including products offered or services performed by third parties. While the absence of complaints does not mean UDAAP issues are not present, the presence of complaints can indicate underlying issues regarding the way products and services are offered and administered that may reflect the existence of UDAAP issues.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Whistleblower Referrals</strong>. Whistleblower referrals made by employees can also indicate potential UDAAP issues. Examples of whistleblower referrals that would indicate increased UDAAP risk include those that focus on the Company&rsquo;s marketing or sales practices or disclose the failure of the Company to deliver products or services as promised.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>High Fee Levels</strong>. Fee income levels that are higher than average or significantly increasing could indicate the existence of products or services susceptible to UDAAP. For example, higher than average or a significant increase in fee income derived from certain products could indicate a potential UDAAP issue if the Company fails to disclose the costs and fees associated with the product.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>High Volume of Charge-Backs</strong>. Significant charge-backs, cancellations of transactions or refunds of fees could also indicate the existence of products or services susceptible to UDAAP. For example, a pattern of refunding fees associated with a specific product or service could indicate associated disclosures or marketing materials may be misleading or confusing. While not always evident in the Company&rsquo;s customer complaint resolution processes, charge-back and refund volumes may be relevant to and reflective of customer complaint volumes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Inadequate Review of Marketing Materials</strong>. Inadequate oversight and review of advertisements, marketing materials and scripts, and sales practices could increase UDAAP risks by not identifying when information marketed or communicated to consumers is misleading, difficult to understand, or differs from actual disclosures or the functionality of a product or service.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>System Inconsistencies.</strong> UDAAP risks increase when account disclosures provided to customers are inconsistent with how the Company&rsquo;s operating system actually maintains an account or processes a transaction. For example, account disclosures state a fee is charged in one manner, but the actual systems calculate the fees in a different manner.&nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Weaknesses in Risk Management</strong>. Inadequate risk management or internal controls (including third-party risk management) over higher risk products or services, such as identity theft protection, may increase a Company&rsquo;s UDAAP risks. Examples of inadequate internal controls may include:&nbsp;</p>
                    <ol type="i" >
                        <li>
                            <p>Inadequate reporting or lack of monitoring to determine whether customers are enrolled and charged multiple times for the same product or service.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Marketing materials and related disclosures are not reviewed by appropriate staff (e.g., legal, compliance, or audit) for clarity, compliance, and accuracy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Customer complaints regarding higher risk products or services (including complaints received by or about related third parties) are not adequately responded to or analyzed for root cause and possible increased risk.&nbsp;</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Inadequate Oversight of Compensation Practices</strong>. UDAAP risks may increase as a result of inadequate board and management oversight over a Company&rsquo;s incentive compensation programs. For example, an incentive compensation program that is not aligned with the board&rsquo;s risk appetite or not balanced with adequate controls could encourage imprudent risk taking or actions by employees.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
                
            <li >
                <h1 >Oversight &amp; Reporting</h1>
            </li>
            <p >SendFriend senior management is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with UDAAP requirements. It will ensure that employees and contractors are aware of these requirements, and will notify the Board of Directors of potential UDAAP violations.&nbsp;</p>

                <p >The legal standards for unfairness and deception are independent of each other. Depending on the facts, a practice may be unfair, deceptive, or both. The legal standards set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act are briefly described below. &nbsp;</p>

                                <p>A representation, omission, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer;&nbsp;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>A consumer&rsquo;s interpretation of the representation, omission, or practice is considered reasonable under the circumstances; or</p>

                                <p>The misleading representation, omission, or practice is material.&nbsp;</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>A material misrepresentation or practice is one that is likely to affect a consumer&rsquo;s choice of or conduct regarding a product. In other words, it is information that is important to consumers. If inaccurate or omitted information is material, injury is likely.&nbsp;</p>
                        <ol type="i" >
                            <li>
                                <p>Certain categories of information are automatically considered material. First, express claims are presumed to be material. The Supreme Court has stated that we may assume that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising. Where the seller knew, or should have known, that an ordinary consumer would need omitted information to evaluate the product or service, or that the claim was false, materiality will be presumed because the business intended the information or omission to have an effect. Similarly, when evidence exists that a business intended to make an implied claim, materiality will be inferred.&nbsp;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Claims or omissions are considered material if they significantly involve health, safety, or other areas with which the reasonable consumer would be concerned. Depending on the facts, information pertaining to the central characteristics of the product or service will be presumed material. Information has been found material where it concerns the purpose, safety, efficacy, or cost, of the product or service. Information is also likely to be material if it concerns durability, performance, warranties, or quality. &nbsp;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>When materiality exists injury to the consumer is also likely to exist because of the representation, omission, sales practice, or marketing technique. Injury to consumers can take many forms. Injury exists if consumers would have chosen differently but for the deception. If different choices are likely, the claim is material, and injury is likely as well. Therefore, injury and materiality are different names for the same concept.&nbsp;</p>

                <p >UDAAP violations can present significant legal, reputational and compliance risks for SendFriend. SendFriend senior management will consider UDAAP implications when analyzing the risks associated with all products and services it offers. They will also consider potential UDAAP risks at every stage of business activity from product development, to the creation and rollout of marketing campaigns, to servicing and collections. They will pay particular attention to new or modified systems or products and third-party arrangements. UDAAP applies to both consumer and commercial services.&nbsp;</p>

                </li>

                <p >SendFriend will follow the below best practices to avoid misleading its customers or the general public about its products and services:&nbsp;</p>
                <ol type="a" >
                    <li>
                        <p>Review all promotional materials, marketing scripts, and customer agreements and disclosures to ensure that they fairly and adequately describe the terms, benefits, and material limitations of the product or service being offered, including any related or optional products or services, and that they do not misrepresent such terms either affirmatively or by omission.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that these materials do not use fine print, separate statements, or inconspicuous disclosures to correct potentially misleading headlines, and ensure that there is a reasonable factual basis for all representations made.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Draw the attention of customers to key terms, including limitations and conditions, that are important in enabling the customer to make an informed decision regarding whether the product or service meets the customer&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clearly disclose all material limitations or conditions on the terms or availability of products or services, such the expiration date for terms that apply only during an introductory period; material prerequisites for obtaining particular products, services, or terms (e.g., minimum transaction amounts, introductory or other fees, or other qualifications); or conditions for canceling a service without charge when the service is offered on a free trial basis.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Inform customers in a clear and timely manner about any fees, penalties, or other charges (including charges for any force-placed products) that have been imposed, and the reasons for their imposition.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clearly inform customers of contract provisions that permit a change in the terms and conditions of an agreement.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>When using terms such as &ldquo;pre-approved&rdquo; or &ldquo;guaranteed,&rdquo; clearly disclose any limitations, conditions, or restrictions on the offer.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clearly inform customers when the account terms approved by SendFriend for the consumer are less favorable than the advertised terms or terms previously disclosed.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Tailor advertisements, promotional materials, disclosures, and scripts to take account of the sophistication and experience of the target audience. It will not make claims, representations or statements that mislead customers of the target audience about the cost, value, availability, cost savings, benefits, or terms of the product or service. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that costs and benefits of optional or related products and services are not misrepresented or presented in an incomplete manner. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Avoid using unrepresentative examples in advertising, marketing, and promotional materials. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Clearly disclose a telephone number and mailing address (and, as an addition, a contact form on its website at <a href="http://www.sendfriend.io/contact">www.sendfriend.io/contact</a>) that customers may use to contact SendFriend or its third-party service providers regarding any complaints they may have, and maintain appropriate procedures for resolving complaints. SendFriend management and compliance staff will review all complaints to identify practices that have the potential to be misleading to customers. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Implement and maintain effective risk and supervisory controls to select and manage third-party servicers. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Ensure that employees and third parties who market or promote SendFriend products are adequately trained to avoid making statements or taking actions that might be unfair or deceptive. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Review compensation arrangements for SendFriend employees as well as third-party vendors and servicers to ensure that they do not create unintended incentives to engage in unfair or deceptive practices. &nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Recognizing the need for clear and accurate disclosures for certain groups of the general public which have been associated in the past with abusive practices, SendFriend will pay particular attention to marketing products and services to the elderly, the financially vulnerable, and customers who are not financially sophisticated.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>

                    <h1 >UDAAP Red Flags</h1>
                </li>

                <p >Red flags are warnings or indictors of a potential problem that poses risk to the Company. The below red flags are examples designed to help SendFriend management identify warning signs of potential areas with higher UDAAP risks.</p>
                <ol type="a" >
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Customer Complaints.</strong> Customer complaints can indicate potential weaknesses or other deficiencies, such as potential UDAAP issues. Complaints can reveal a weakness in a particular product or service or can identify customers&rsquo; dissatisfaction with or lack of understanding of products or services, including products offered or services performed by third parties. While the absence of complaints does not mean UDAAP issues are not present, the presence of complaints can indicate underlying issues regarding the way products and services are offered and administered that may reflect the existence of UDAAP issues.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Whistleblower Referrals</strong>. Whistleblower referrals made by employees can also indicate potential UDAAP issues. Examples of whistleblower referrals that would indicate increased UDAAP risk include those that focus on the Company&rsquo;s marketing or sales practices or disclose the failure of the Company to deliver products or services as promised.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>High Fee Levels</strong>. Fee income levels that are higher than average or significantly increasing could indicate the existence of products or services susceptible to UDAAP. For example, higher than average or a significant increase in fee income derived from certain products could indicate a potential UDAAP issue if the Company fails to disclose the costs and fees associated with the product.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>High Volume of Charge-Backs</strong>. Significant charge-backs, cancellations of transactions or refunds of fees could also indicate the existence of products or services susceptible to UDAAP. For example, a pattern of refunding fees associated with a specific product or service could indicate associated disclosures or marketing materials may be misleading or confusing. While not always evident in the Company&rsquo;s customer complaint resolution processes, charge-back and refund volumes may be relevant to and reflective of customer complaint volumes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Inadequate Review of Marketing Materials</strong>. Inadequate oversight and review of advertisements, marketing materials and scripts, and sales practices could increase UDAAP risks by not identifying when information marketed or communicated to consumers is misleading, difficult to understand, or differs from actual disclosures or the functionality of a product or service.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>System Inconsistencies.</strong> UDAAP risks increase when account disclosures provided to customers are inconsistent with how the Company&rsquo;s operating system actually maintains an account or processes a transaction. For example, account disclosures state a fee is charged in one manner, but the actual systems calculate the fees in a different manner.&nbsp;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Weaknesses in Risk Management</strong>. Inadequate risk management or internal controls (including third-party risk management) over higher risk products or services, such as identity theft protection, may increase a Company&rsquo;s UDAAP risks. Examples of inadequate internal controls may include:&nbsp;</p>
                        <ol type="i" >
                            <li>
                                <p>Inadequate reporting or lack of monitoring to determine whether customers are enrolled and charged multiple times for the same product or service.&nbsp;</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Marketing materials and related disclosures are not reviewed by appropriate staff (e.g., legal, compliance, or audit) for clarity, compliance, and accuracy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Customer complaints regarding higher risk products or services (including complaints received by or about related third parties) are not adequately responded to or analyzed for root cause and possible increased risk.&nbsp;</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Inadequate Oversight of Compensation Practices</strong>. UDAAP risks may increase as a result of inadequate board and management oversight over a Company&rsquo;s incentive compensation programs. For example, an incentive compensation program that is not aligned with the board&rsquo;s risk appetite or not balanced with adequate controls could encourage imprudent risk taking or actions by employees.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    
                <li >
                    <h1 >Oversight &amp; Reporting</h1>
                </li>
                <p >SendFriend senior management is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with UDAAP requirements. It will ensure that employees and contractors are aware of these requirements, and will notify the Board of Directors of potential UDAAP violations.&nbsp;</p>
